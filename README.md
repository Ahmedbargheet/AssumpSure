## üéØ Purpose
<img align="right" src="inst/app/www/logo.png" width="200" style="margin-top:40px;">

**AssumpSure** is a user-friendly **R Shiny application** that helps researchers validate statistical assumptions and select appropriate tests before analysis, ensuring valid, transparent, and reproducible results.

Misused statistical tests due to overlooked or misinterpreted assumptions can undermine scientific findings. 

With **AssumpSure**, you can:

- **Validate** statistical assumptions automatically.
- **Choose** the right test for your data with confidence.
- **Generate** publication-ready plots and summaries in one click, demonstrating transparent test selection to reviewers and readers.

---

## üë• Who is it for?

**AssumpSure** is perfect for:

- Researchers with limited statistical expertise.
- Students, clinicians, and early-career scientists seeking a **code-free analysis workflow**.
- Teams needing reproducible, publication-ready statistical outputs.
- Anyone unsure if their data meets test assumptions.

---

## üì¶ Key Features

- **Automatically check** test assumptions (normality, homogeneity, homoscedasticity, collinearity, etc.).
- **Evaluate** your test selection and recommend alternatives when appropriate.
- **Apply** Log, Yeo-Johnson, or Box-Cox transformations to non-normal data for LM and LMM, with before-and-after visualizations.
- **Support** a wide range of statistical methods.
- **Generate** boxplots, effect plots, and diagnostic plots for transparent reporting.
- **Export** plots and tables for reports or publications with **one click**.
- **Provide** an intuitive interface for users with no programming experience.

---

## üß™ Supported Statistical Methods

- T-tests (independent & paired)
- Mann-Whitney U test
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test
- One-way ANOVA
- Kruskal-Wallis test
- Chi-square and Fisher‚Äôs exact tests
- Correlation analyses (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall, and Biweight midcorrelation)
- Linear and linear mixed-effects models
- Logistic, multinomial, Poisson and negative binomial regression

## üìÅ Installation
**Important:** Please use R 4.2 or newer.
### CRAN

```r
install.packages("AssumpSure")
```
### GitHub
```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Install AssumpSure package
devtools::install_github("Ahmedbargheet/AssumpSure")
```

## üìö Reproducible Examples
The examples below demonstrate how to use each analysis module in *AssumpSure*.
The `infants.csv` dataset is downloadable within the app (Help tab), while the remaining example datasets are available [here](https://github.com/Ahmedbargheet/AssumpSure/tree/main/inst/extdata) on GitHub.
Screenshots display the expected outputs for verifying functionality and reproducibility.
