---

## 📦 Key Features

- **Automatically check** test assumptions (normality, homogeneity, homoscedasticity, collinearity, etc.).
- **Evaluate** your test selection and recommend alternatives when appropriate.
- **Apply** Log, Yeo-Johnson, or Box-Cox transformations to non-normal data for LM and LMM, with before-and-after visualizations.
- **Support** a wide range of statistical methods.
